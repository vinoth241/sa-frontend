# hackathon-05-2018

Repo hosts the code for hakathon conducted in May 2018. <br/><br/>
Dont use the master branch for any commits. Please create a new branch for each team so that it is easier to manage code. 

It is not compulsory to use the hackathon repo. 
* This repo is for teams who are building something from scratch and need a git repo to commit their code to.
* If you are building your hack on top say freshdesk(helpkit), please create the branch in the helpkit repo.
